"# SpaceProject" 
 In general, the space enthusiast community wishes an app existed that combines multiple sources of space information in one place -- and as we researched, we understood why. Not many APIs exist, and the ones that do are only good for raw or super technical data. But the cool images and interesting updates that they desire require browsing multiple websites and specific research -- which can be a lot of work if you're not motivated. This is our app where a user can find out relevant information about space missions and events from multiple news sources, access space images such as NASA's picture of the day, and see what Astronauts are up to right now via their tweets. The user can also add upcoming astronomical events to their calendar. All articles and tweets can be shared via whichever social media app the user prefers.
